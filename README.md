# Text Similarity Checker

## Description
This project compares two input texts and calculates how similar they are using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to produce a similarity percentage.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NLP (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)

## How It Works
1. Takes two text inputs from the user
2. Converts them into TF-IDF vectors
3. Computes cosine similarity
4. Displays similarity percentage

## Applications
- Plagiarism Detection
- Document Comparison
- Search Systems
